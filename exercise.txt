1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words?
- A terminal is a text based interface that allows you to give your computer specific commands. 
  Within a terminal you can edit files, open, close, create, delete, as well as navigate around your computer.
  The terminal has built in shortcuts that allow for smooth navigation. 

2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?
- Git is software for version control. Git can be used with in the terminal. 
  Version control allows you to have historic data of files you have created, modified, and (or) deleted.
  These files are called repositories. Git allows you to access which ever version of the repository you may need.
  This is handy when working on projects with teammates and want to deligate tasks but also review individual work.
  It keeps a records of the changes that were made.
  GitHub is an online platform where you can upload these repositories for the public. 
  Git is used locally on your own computer while GitHub is used online and can be accessed from anywhere by anyone.

3. What are the steps to fork a GitHub repository?
- In order to fork a repository, you will need to be within a repository on GitHub.
  Once you are there, you will see a button in the top right corner area that says 'Fork" paired with a fork icon.
  Clicking this will alllow you to fork,create a copy of, a repository. This fork will include all of the previous commits.
  Forking is similar to a branch but it doesn't make any changes to original file. Forking is good for using others code as a 
  starting point or for making suggestions to code and having the original project creator review the code for for committing the changes.
  If you fork a repository and make changes you would then make a pull request and it would be up to the owner of the repository 
  to accept those changes.
